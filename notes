Soooooooo


circle.yml
-- what circleci does
-- installs weeyuck on circle
-- copys bin to wherever circle does the tests
-- runs scratch
   -- scratch creates a directory tree with necessary files
   -- docker imports all the files into an empty image called haskell-scratch:latest
-- docker builds an image? called weeyuck(commit) that contains all those files <- how does this relate to the haskell-scratch?
   -- "-t <repo>" means the image has a repository and tag
   -- this is what runs the Dockerfile
-- rms the bin
-- pushes the image to the repo

Dockerfile
-- what happens when???
